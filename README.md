# Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts

This project is my solution to **Codecademy Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts** (Web Development Fundamentals).

## Objectives

In this project, I had to build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store.

The pageâ€™s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) was outlined in a design spec which I followed.
